## Description

The purpose of this project is to build a Node.js command-line application that takes in information about employees on a software engineering team, then generate an HTML webpage that displays summaries for each person. This project also features the use of testing through Node.js's built in package called [Jest](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jest). To take user input the project also features the use of the [Inquirer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer) package.
